As we all know that election is the most important phase for any country and it's citizens. So, to make it secure, reliable and transparent is the foremost duty of Election Commission of that country. In India, since the past couple of years, there has been a lot of questions on EVMs security and it's tampering. So, there is an urgent need to come up with a more secure way of its processing.

### **IDEA**

I think that Blockchain technology by Azure can help out with this. I have prepared my Idea which I think can help.

Every voter will be provided with a unique USER ID by Election Commission of India and their data will be linked with ADHAAR card. So, when a voter will go to cast their vote, they will be asked to verify themselves by their USER ID provided or by biometric data stored with ADHAAR. Next, when he will go inside to cast vote, he will be asked a 4 digit PIN just like what happens in ATM. If PIN matches, he will be allowed to cast vote.

To make the election more transparent, we can send the details of the vote back to the voter after his casting. Details like party name and time of cast will be delivered to the voter either by mobile number registered or through Email or can be uploaded on any personnel Govt. account instead of using VVPAT. If the voter finds any blunder then he can contact to Govt. officials.

To make it possible for the voter to cast his vote from a different location, we can get his data from the server and can verify him with his USER ID. We can also provide people who are new to voting to register themselves online. This will help to manage and store data well. We will try to do most of the things online as much as possible. For biometric, he has to register offline. A unique USER ID will be provided online as soon as voter verifies himself offline and can print it and use it during verification at the polling booth. Online, he can also change his unique 4 digit PIN code which will be used before vote casting.

#### **Computing is always faster than working manually**

Azure blockchain can help us to get fast election results. We can program it to count votes from the very first day but will display result later or can start a live server which will display live result and update itself constantly to add more transparency and security. Blockchain is secure and very difficult for anyone to tamper with the data. Voter's data which include the party's name, time and voter details will be secured cryptographically. Request to get into the main blockchain will emerge randomly from different constituencies which will make it difficult to hack and tamper with details from a particular constituency or area. Because getting details of a particular block will alter the address of block behind it.
